### What is FastTrack for Microsoft 365? <a href="#what-is-fasttrack-for-microsoft-365" id="what-is-fasttrack-for-microsoft-365"></a>

Microsoft 365 FastTrack is a service designed to help organizations seamlessly deploy Microsoft 365 solutions to better allow users to work effectively and productively. FastTrack provides remote guidance to help organizations learn, prepare, and deploy Microsoft 365 services quickly and efficiently.

To effectively deploy Microsoft 365, Microsoft Viva, and security services, FastTrack utilizes step-by-step deployment guides. These guides simplify the deployment process and help organizations utilize Microsoft 365 services as quickly as possible.

FastTrack works with a network of certified partners who provide expertise in deploying Microsoft 365 solutions. These partners help organizations navigate the deployment process, customize the approach to meet your specific needs, and provide further support to ensure successful adoption to drive effective utilization of your services. Partners also recommend other services for customers (in addition to the FastTrack benefit) for a fee to enhance your deployment experience. Those services are determined on a case-by-case basis based on your particular requirements and wants.

With FastTrack, organizations can use the full power of Microsoft 365, including Microsoft Teams, Viva, and security. By following the deployment guides and working with certified partners, organizations can quickly and easily deploy Microsoft 365 and help their users collaborate.

FastTrack offers assistance in the following languages: Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese (resources speak Mandarin only), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish.
