### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps <a href="#microsoft-defender-for-cloud-apps" id="microsoft-defender-for-cloud-apps"></a>

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is a multi-purpose software-as-a-service (SaaS) security solution.

By adopting a SaaS security approach, you can easily identify misconfigurations. This improves your overall app posture, implements policies to protect sensitive data, and protects app-to-app scenarios to ensure that only apps have the acceptable permissions to access other app data. When you natively integrate into Microsoft Defender XDR, organizations like yours benefit from using the signal from SaaS to actively hunt in their environments and combat incidents across their apps, devices, identities, and email.
